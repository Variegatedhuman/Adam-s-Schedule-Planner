# Adam's Schedule Planner

Creation of a daily schedule planner to aid users in organizing their daily tasks.

## Project Goal

Project fulfills the following criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist

## Goal Fulfillment

When the daily planner it opened the current day and time is displayed in the header

When the user scrolls down they are presented with timeblocks for 8am-5pm

As time goes on, timeblock colors adjust to reflect timeblocks that are in the past, present, and future

When the user clicks on a timeblock they can enter an event

When the user clicks the 'save' icon their event is stored in local storage

When the user refreshes the page their event is retrieved from local storage and is displayed in it's designated timeblock
